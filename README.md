# Gyrosaur
Project that allows the FRDM-K64F board to be used as a motion controller for the Offline Chrome Dinosaur Game.

## Installation
Build the project as normal in uVision and push to board. Then clone and run the [UARTPythonController](https://github.com/Pdbz199/UARTPythonController) we've developed. There is a README.md on the GitHub page for that as well.
